                    <p>Antoni Gaudí i Cornet (1852-1926) was a Catalan Spanish architect who was primarily influenced by nature, by
                    natural organic forms and it's patterns. He was known to have said “originality consists of going back to the origins”.
                    Gaudí became part of the Catalan Modernista movement centered in Barcelona whose main but not only form of expression was
                    architecture. He was inspired by Islamic, Moorish, Indian, Persian, Egyptian, Japanese and Chinese art. He experimented
                    with gothic and baroque styles, later developing his own distinct style with juxtapositions of geometric masses,
                    surfaces of patterned brick or stone, bright ceramic tiles and floral metalwork. He created a type of structure known as
                    equilibrated, that is it could stand on its own without internal bracing or external support.  
                    
                    <br><br> 
                    Gaudí was a devout catholic and his faith only deepened in his later years. He included religious images in most of his works.
                    It is his faith, his passion, his design and vision for La Sagrada Familia that have earned him the title “God's Architect”.
                    The Association for the Beatification of Antoni Gaudí are working on the possibility of his canonization.<br><br>
                    
                    Barcelona became home to most of his works. Many have been classified as World Heritage. The most popular 
                    are Park Güell, Casa Batlló, Casa Milà and his opus magnum still under construction La Sagrada Familia.</p>
